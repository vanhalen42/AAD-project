# AAD-project
We as humans continue to explore the vast reaches of space and expand our presence
beyond the earth. But to do that, we need to be able to plan and use the resources at
our destinations in the most creative and optimal way possible to survive.
This project is a plan of human colonies on one or more planets/moons like mars, the
moon, Europa, the asteroid belt, etc. How would you optimize the locations of
facilities(like water, minerals, and so on) to make the best use of the given
resources.
